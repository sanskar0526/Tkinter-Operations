Hello there! I'm Sanskar Sonawane, a Python enthusiast and GUI developer with a strong passion for creating intuitive and efficient software solutions.
I am a passionate and detail-oriented student currently pursuing a degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My technical journey began with Python fundamentals, and I soon found a deep interest in building desktop applications using Tkinter, Python’s standard GUI library.
I started learning Tkinter out of curiosity—wanting to understand how desktop applications are created behind the scenes. Initially, I began with simple widgets like buttons, labels, and entry fields, and gradually progressed to building complete functional applications. Each project I completed helped me solidify my knowledge in event handling, layout management, and user interface design.
Over time, I transitioned from creating basic tools to more interactive and feature-rich applications, improving not only my coding skills but also my understanding of software design principles and user experience.
